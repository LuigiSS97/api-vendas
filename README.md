## api-vendas
This repo is set specifically for studying purpouses, it is a sales api with the most used principles of backend programming. It's a node API which uses PostgreSQL, express, jwt token (it includes a authentication/ user session module), Docker. It was tested and validated with insomnia. And, not less important, the application includes a product CRUD and user CRUD.

To run a local server, run the <npm run dev> at your prefered terminal placed in the root folder of this project. It also necessary to run a docker container.

I would like to thank Aluizio for the course with the lessons which covered the concepts and explanations about this project. :D
